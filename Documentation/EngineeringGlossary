UndoneShell Commands:

coredump
  Displays the current state of the system, including registers, loaded programs, failed programs, and memory.

errordump [program_name]
  Prints error messages for the specified program or all programs if no name is provided.

execute [programs...]
  Loads and runs the specified programs.

exit
  Exits the UndoneShell.

gantt
  Outputs the Gantt chart for the system's processes.

getpagefaults
  Outputs information about page faults.

getpagenumber
  Displays the current page count in the system's memory configuration.

getpagesize
  Displays the current page size in the system's memory configuration.

help
  Displays a brief description of the UndoneShell.

load [programs...]
  Loads the specified programs into memory. Ensure the programs have the `.osx` extension and exist on the filesystem.

osx_mac [file.asm] [loader_address] [-v]
  Compiles an assembly file for macOS with an optional loader address and verbose flag.

ps
